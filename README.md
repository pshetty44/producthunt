### 1 Motivation:

[ProductHunt.com](https://www.producthunt.com) is a collection of product postings on which visitors can comment and upvote. Companies (or small teams, or even individuals) can post their products on ProductHunt in an effort to disseminate it to ProductHunt’s large audience.
Data.world has compiled the most comprehensive ProductHunt dataset ever released. 2 years of posts, votes, taglines, and more!

Recently, **data.world** and **Galvanize** orgranized a **mini-hackathon** in an effort to discover which types of products tend to perform well, and possibly discover why. My team won the **“Best Visualization”** category for producing a “story” of
sequential visualizations exploring the differences between highly up voted posts and posts that don’t generate a lot of interest on product hunt.
In addition to the analysis done at mini-hackathon, I have also added a predicion model to predict the number of votes a product can get.
